		<p>Isabella is 10 years old and the niece of Rosalee Mcgilvery. They love spending time together crafting and creating. Isabella started drawing at just the age 4 and fell in love with it. Inspired by bold colors, corgis and “anything cute”, you’ll find lots of renditions of animals and popular characters in her signature style. See a handful of her selected artwork by peaking in the windows below. Follow along on her journey and watch her talent grow!</p>
